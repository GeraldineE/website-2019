We want to encourage more women to dominate the web! That's why from Django Girls Colombia and PyCon Colombia with the support of Python Colombia and Argentina in Python we are organizing a workshop on February 7 where you can build your own website from scratch in a day. In addition, we will use all the tools that professional programmers use daily. And in a very simple way!

You can participate as Assistant to learn in the workshop or as Coach (If you are fluent in Spanish) serving as a mentor to the attendees

**Only requirement:** Register and wait for confirmation email on January 21.
