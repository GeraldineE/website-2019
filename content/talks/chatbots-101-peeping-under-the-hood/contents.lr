##  **Overview**
Google Assistant and Siris' of the world have tickled our curiosity enough to deep dive and understand under the hood technologies that make a chatbot. Though we don't have Google level of data to create a generalized chatbot, we can use the existing NLP engines and develop chatbots that produce valuable results in a specific domain. For eg., anything that goes in your FAQ page can be converted into content for a chatbot.

In this talk, I'll share my 2-year journey with chatbots. Existing bot platforms and how to leverage it to build your chatbots and connect it with messaging platforms like slack, telegram, etc.,
